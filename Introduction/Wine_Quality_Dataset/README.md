**B. Outline of Steps** 

1. Decide what questions to pose

2. Extract the data  

3. Import data into environment  

4. Perform exploratory data analysis to gain overview of dataset

5. Create visualisations to aid and augment exploration 

6. Draw conclusions


**C. What Questions To Ask?**

1. How many samples of red wine are there?

2. How many samples of white wine are there?

3. How many variables are in each dataset?

4. Which features have missing values?

5. How many duplicate rows are in the white wine dataset?

6. Are duplicate rows in these datasets significant/need to be dropped?

7. How many unique values of quality are in the red wine dataset?

8. How many unique values of quality are in the white wine dataset?

9. What is the mean density in the red wine dataset?

10. Is a certain type of wine (red or white) associated with higher quality?

11. What level of acidity (pH value) receives the highest average rating?

12. Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings? 

13. Do sweeter wines (more residual sugar) receive better ratings What level of acidity receives the highest average rating?

**D. Key Findings**
1. Income has grown steadily since across the world since the turn of the century
2. Fixed line connections as a mode of communucation has declined across the world since the turn of the century
3. After explosive growth early in the century, phone line connections have begun to show signs of saturation
4. Broadband connections contiunue to grow as a mode of communcation across the globe
5. Europe is a leader among the continents across all of the variables measured
6. Africa is the only continent to display a decling trend in the number of broadband connections
