2. Extract the data  

3. Import data into environment  

4. Perform exploratory data analysis to gain overview of dataset

6. Draw conclusions


**C. What Questions To Ask?**

1. How have income, fixed, phone and broadband changed over time?

2. What is the shape of the distribution for the latest year for which data is available?

3. How does the shape of the distribution differ across geographical regions for 2018?

4. What relationship, if any, is there between income, fixed, phone and broadband?

**D. Key Findings**
