# Udacity_DataAnalysis_Nanodegree_WeatherTrends

 **1. Determine Objectives**
 
The task is to extract data pertaining to global and city temperatures and to subsequently analyse the data to draw conclusions.


**A) Outline of Steps** 

>1. Decide what questions to pose

>2. Extract the data  

>3. Import data into local environment  

>4. Perform exploratory data analysis to gain overview of dataset

>5. Create visualisations to aid and augment exploration 

>6. Draw conclusions


**B) What are the desired outputs?** 

>1. Project submission 

>2. Accurately answer all questions 

>3. Learn - SQL queries, rolling averages, line chart plotting


**C) What Questions To Ask?**

>1. Is London hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average?

>2. Has the difference been consistent over time?

>3. How do the changes in London's temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?

>4. What does the overall trend look like?

>5. Is the world getting hotter or cooler?

>6. Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?


The first chapter was an introduction to the following projects of the Data Analyst Nanodegree.

First chapter project was about weather trends - it required to apply (atleast) the following steps:

Extract data from a database using a SQL query
Calculate a moving average
Create a line chart
I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in three german cities to overall global temperature trends. After cleaning the data, I've created a function, which was supposed to handle all the tasks that are needed to plot the data - for example calculating the linear trend and calculating the rolling average. In addition, the function had other various options for the visualization to get various graphs.

Key findings:

the average global temperature is increasing, with an also increasing tempo
London is the only city in UK in this dataset which has a higher average temperature than the global average
