#  Explore Weather Trends

The first chapter project was a gentle introduction to the Data Analyst Nanodegree. Successful completion required the application of the following steps:

1) Data extraction from a database using a SQL query
2) Calculation of a moving average
3) Creation of a line chart


**A. Determine Objectives**
 
The task is to extract data pertaining to global and city temperatures and to subsequently analyse the data to draw conclusions.

**B. Outline of Steps** 

>1. Decide what questions to pose

>2. Extract the data  

>3. Import data into local environment  

>4. Perform exploratory data analysis to gain overview of dataset

>5. Create visualisations to aid and augment exploration 

>6. Draw conclusions


**C. What Questions To Ask?**

>1. Is London hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average?

>2. Has the difference been consistent over time?

>3. How do the changes in London's temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?

>4. What does the overall trend look like?

>5. Is the world getting hotter or cooler?

>6. Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?


**D. Key findings**

1. The average global temperature is increasing, with an also increasing tempo
2. London has a higher average temperature than the global average
