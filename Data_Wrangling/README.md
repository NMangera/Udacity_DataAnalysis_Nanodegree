# Gather, Clean and Analyze Twitter Data (WeRateDogsâ„¢ (@dog_rates))

This chapter is a deep dive into the data wrangling part of the data analysis process. Topics include the difference between messy and dirty data and what tidy data looks like.

 **A. Determine Objectives**

This project focused on wrangling data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. 
The archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. The data is enhanced with a second dataset with predictions of dog breeds for each of the Tweets. Finally, the Twitter API to used to glean further basic information from the Tweet such as favourites and retweets. 

**B. Project Details**

Fully assessing and cleaning the entire dataset would require exceptional effort so only a subset of its issues (eight quality issues and two tidiness issues) are considered.


The tasks for this project are:


Data wrangling, consists of:
1. Gathering data
2. Assessing data
3. Cleaning data
4. Storing, analyzing, and visualizing wrangled data

**C. Key Points**

-Only want original ratings that have images. 

-Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.

-The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.

**D. Outline of Steps** 

1. Decide what questions to pose

2. Extract the data  

3. Import data into environment  

4. Create visualisations to aid and augment exploration 

5. Draw conclusions


**D. Key findings**
